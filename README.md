# AstarBase (or AstarPass)

## Introduction
There are couple of facts for Shiden/Astar ecosystem:
1. Majority of the crowdloan participants used their Polkadot native addresses and these users are the majority of dApps-Staking participants. 
2. While we are building multi virtual Machine future, the matter of fact is that today most of the dApps are using Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) which is using Ethereum address space, usually referred as MetaMask accounts or H160.
4. Our unique feature is dApps Staking which is providing basic income for developers and staking mechanism for the users. Both dApps developers and users benefit from it.

## Goals
The goals of this project are to:
1. Bring more users to EVM dApps
2. Create more opportunities for end users to participate in ecosystem 
3. Enable EVM dApps to attract and reward users even though they have majority of their funds staked on dApps Staking
4. Encourage users to stake and use dApps Staking mechanism

## Scope
The front-end implementation for this project will allow user to connect with Polkadot and EVM wallet (Like MetaMask) at the same time and write this address pair to the EVM smart contract.
The EVM smart contract (AstarBase) will verify on-chain that used addresses are valid and that users are participating in the dApps Staking.

## Targeted users
After EVM smart contract (AstarBase) is filled with user's addresses, the dApps will be able to call it to verify if an address is used in dApps Staking

## Use Cases for Users
- NFT smart contracts can be programmed to be minted only by users in AstarBase or give discounts to those users
- Gaming dApps can have base of 20k (or more) users and they can attract them by exclusive items
- Claim ERC20 airdrops according to the amount staked in dApps Staking
- Metaverse projects can give free avatars or land...
- DeFi

## Use Cases for dApps
* One of the biggest challenges for new projects is how to attract users. The AstarBase is a tool that enables dApps to provide benefit for users and attract new ones.

## How to motivate users to register in AstarBase?
* create articles and AMA sessions explaining benefits for users
* NFT airdrop for AstarBase users on both Shiden and Astar
